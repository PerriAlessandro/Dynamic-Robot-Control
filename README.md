# Dynamic-Robot-Control
This project is focused on the Dynamic Control of a manipulator using MATLAB and Simulink. The repository contains a simple simulation model of a UR5 robot which can be controlled by providing torque commands to the joints. Joint position, velocity, and acceleration can also be read.

## Repository Content
The repository includes the following files:

- Assignment.pdf: This file contains the detailed specifications of the exercises.
- Report.pdf: This file contains more details and results on the project.
- sml_models folder: This folder contains Simulink models.
## Required Packages
To run the MATLAB code and Simulink models, the following packages must be installed from the MATLAB Add-On Browser:

- Robotic Systems Toolbox
- Simscape Multibody
- Robot Library Data Support Package.
## Exercise Overview
The project includes the following exercises:

- Exercise 1 – Gravity Compensation
- Exercise 2 – Linear Joint Control
- Exercise 3 – Linear Cartesian Control
- Exercise 4 – Computed Torque Control
## Contributors
This project has been developed by Alessandro Perri.
